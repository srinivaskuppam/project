Is there a specific procedure to follow when making a claim?,"Yes, there is a specific procedure to follow when making a claim. This includes providing personal details, policy number, car registration number, description of the loss or damage, and the other driver's details if applicable. It is important to have these details handy when getting in touch to make a claim. Additionally, it is important to inform the insurance company about the accident as quickly as possible to enable them to contact the other party and resolve the claim efficiently.",Making a Claim,qa,"['Page 26Making Motor Legal Cover claims\nAccepting your claim\nBefore we cover your costs, we must accept \nthat you have a valid claim.We’ll only accept your claim if:\n>The incident happened within the territorial \nlimits – except where covered abroad.\n>You were covered on the date of incident.\n>The legal proceedings will happen in a court\nwithin the territorial limits – except where \ncovered abroad.\nFollowing the policy terms\nYou must do all of the following: \n>Comply with all of the terms of this policy.\n>Take all reasonable precautions to minimise \nthe cost of claims.\n>Take all reasonable precautions to prevent a claim from happening. \nIf you haven’t followed any of the terms of this \npolicy, and this prejudices our position, we have the right to: \n>Refuse or withdraw from the claim.\n>Refuse to cover costs – even if we’ve already \nagreed to them.\n>Ask you to reimburse costs that we’ve \nalready paid.\nChoosing who represents you\nYou can choose an appointed representative to \nlook after your interests. This will include looking \nafter your interests in any inquiry or other court\nproceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. Your appointed representative can be:\n>From a preferred law firm that we suggest.\n>Your own choice of appointed representative\n– however you can’t choose your own appointed representative if it’s a contract dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.\nIf you choose an appointed representative who \nisn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree \nto our terms of appointment. We’ll only cover \ntheir costs from the date they agree to our terms \nof appointment .\nYou’ll have a separate contract with your appointed representative. If they charge any costs that we don’t agree, you’ll be responsible for paying these.\nChecking whether your claim has a reasonable \nchance of succeeding\nBefore we go ahead, we must agree with your \nappointed representative that your claim has a reasonable chance of succeeding. We will \nonly provide this cover as long as we and your appointed representative agree your claim has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the \nduration of the claim. This can change during your claim. \nSometimes the costs of a legal action may \nbe too much in relation to the value of your \nclaim, this relates to a legal test that is referred to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may not provide further cover for your claim. When looking at how much your claim will cost to take legal action versus the potential benefit to be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider things like: \n>The difficulty of the case. Cases which are \nmore difficult usually have greater legal costs\nattached to them.\n>The potential total value of the case. This includes the amount of damages you may be able to recover from the other party.\n>The non-financial value of the case. Sometimes your claim will have a benefit to you which is difficult to value in financial terms but is still worth pursuing. For these claims your \nappointed representative  will \ntake the benefit to you into account when calculating the total value of your claim.\n>If it would be reasonable to spend more in pursuing a claim than the benefit you would get in doing so.\nYour \nappointed representative  will assess the \npotential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost to take legal action.\nIf there are conflicting opinions about whether \nyour claim is likely to succeed, we’ll ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister. We’ll agree which barrister with you.\nIf the barrister agrees with you, you won’t need \nto pay for their advice.

 'Page 7Making a claim\nHow repairs and replacements work\nThis page explains how we’ll repair your car. \nWe’ll only do this if it makes financial sense for \nus to do so. For more details, see: \n>Section 2: Fire and theft on page 14. \n>Section 4: Accidental damage on page 18. \n>Section 5: Windscreen damage on page 20.\nRepairs to your car\nIf our approved repairer carries out the repairs, \nyou do not need an estimate, and you will benefit\nfrom our 5-year Guarantee. This means parts, \nmaterials and workmanship provided by our \napproved repairer are guaranteed for five years,\nunless you sell your car or end your lease. Your \ncar will not qualify for repair under our 5-year \nGuarantee if the cause is a lack of maintenance,\nwear and tear, or a subsequent incident. \nWhere we have agreed this with you, \nreasonable and necessary repairs can be carried out at a repairer of your choice. However, you must give us full details of the incident and we must approve the repairer’s detailed assessment of the repairs before the work begins. We may then make the arrangements for the repairs ourselves. \nWhere the repairs are carried out at a repairer \nof your choice, those repairs will NOT be guaranteed by us even though we may pay for them directly. For the purposes of this policy, \nthose repairs will not be treated as being carried out by our approved repairer.\nIf there is a problem with any aspect of the repair, your first port of call is the repairer who did the original work. If you’re still unhappy with any aspect of the repairs, please let us know.\nWindscreen repairs\nWe may decide to replace your car’s glass \nwith glass that hasn’t been made by your car’s \nmanufacturer but is of a similar standard. If you arrange windscreen repairs or \nreplacement with someone who isn’t an approved windscreen supplier, you don’t need to get our approval beforehand. However, we’ll only cover a limited amount – see ‘Section 5: Windscreen damage’ on page 20.The excess amounts for windscreen repairs \nand replacement are shown on your car \ninsurance details.\nReplacing parts in your car\nWe may decide to repair your car with \nparts that haven’t been made by your car’s \nmanufacturer, but that are of a similar \nstandard. This can include recycled parts. If any part or accessory is not available, the most we’ll pay for that part will be the cost shown in the manufacturer’s last UK price list (plus reasonable fitting costs).\nRemoving, delivering and storing your car\nIf we’re dealing with your claim under sections 2 \nor 4 of your  policy and your car can’t be driven, \nwe’ll cover reasonable costs to take it to the nearest suitable repairer. \nWe’ll help you and your passengers make \narrangements to get home, to your original destination or take you to a safe place.\nWe’ll also cover the reasonable cost of delivering your car to you (at the address shown \non your car insurance details) after it’s repaired.\nIf we need to put your car into safe storage at \nany time, we’ll cover the reasonable cost of storage.\nIf your car is written off\nIf your car is written off and we agree to settle \nyour claim on that basis, we will have met our responsibilities to you under the policy.\nWe will not refund any of your premium if you pay annually. If you pay by instalments under a credit agreement you must pay to us (1) all instalment payments that have already fallen due under the credit agreement and remain unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement. If we agree to pay your claim and you have not paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) above, we may reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount that you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you asking you for the full payment\n.\nOnce we settle your claim, your car will become \nour property and you must send us the registration document. All cover will then end unless we agree differently.'

Your \ncar will not qualify for repair under our 5-year \nGuarantee if the cause is a lack of maintenance,\nwear and tear, or a subsequent incident. \nWhere we have agreed this with you, \nreasonable and necessary repairs can be carried out at a repairer of your choice. However, you must give us full details of the incident and we must approve the repairer’s detailed assessment of the repairs before the work begins. We may then make the arrangements for the repairs ourselves. \nWhere the repairs are carried out at a repairer \nof your choice, those repairs will NOT be guaranteed by us even though we may pay for them directly. For the purposes of this policy, \nthose repairs will not be treated as being carried out by our approved repairer.\nIf there is a problem with any aspect of the repair, your first port of call is the repairer who did the original work. If you’re still unhappy with any aspect of the repairs, please let us know.\nWindscreen repairs\nWe may decide to replace your car’s glass \nwith glass that hasn’t been made by your car’s \nmanufacturer but is of a similar standard. If you arrange windscreen repairs or \nreplacement with someone who isn’t an approved windscreen supplier, you don’t need to get our approval beforehand. However, we’ll only cover a limited amount – see ‘Section 5: Windscreen damage’ on page 20.The excess amounts for windscreen repairs \nand replacement are shown on your car \ninsurance details.\nReplacing parts in your car\nWe may decide to repair your car with \nparts that haven’t been made by your car’s \nmanufacturer, but that are of a similar \nstandard. This can include recycled parts. If any part or accessory is not available, the most we’ll pay for that part will be the cost shown in the manufacturer’s last UK price list (plus reasonable fitting costs).\nRemoving, delivering and storing your car\nIf we’re dealing with your claim under sections 2 \nor 4 of your  policy and your car can’t be driven, \nwe’ll cover reasonable costs to take it to the nearest suitable repairer. \nWe’ll help you and your passengers make \narrangements to get home, to your original destination or take you to a safe place.\nWe’ll also cover the reasonable cost of delivering your car to you (at the address shown \non your car insurance details) after it’s repaired.\nIf we need to put your car into safe storage at \nany time, we’ll cover the reasonable cost of storage.\nIf your car is written off\nIf your car is written off and we agree to settle \nyour claim on that basis, we will have met our responsibilities to you under the policy.\nWe will not refund any of your premium if you pay annually. If you pay by instalments under a credit agreement you must pay to us (1) all instalment payments that have already fallen due under the credit agreement and remain unpaid, and (2) the total remaining balance under the credit agreement. If we agree to pay your claim and you have not paid the amounts due to us under (1) and (2) above, we may reduce the amount that we pay in settlement of your claim by the amount that you owe us. Alternatively, we may write to you asking you for the full payment\n.\nOnce we settle your claim, your car will become \nour property and you must send us the registration document.

This will include looking \nafter your interests in any inquiry or other court\nproceedings, or if there’s any conflict of interest. Your appointed representative can be:\n>From a preferred law firm that we suggest.\n>Your own choice of appointed representative\n– however you can’t choose your own appointed representative if it’s a contract dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.\nIf you choose an appointed representative who \nisn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree \nto our terms of appointment.

We will \nonly provide this cover as long as we and your appointed representative agree your claim has a reasonable chance of succeeding for the \nduration of the claim. This can change during your claim. \nSometimes the costs of a legal action may \nbe too much in relation to the value of your \nclaim, this relates to a legal test that is referred to as ‘proportionality’. In these cases, we may not provide further cover for your claim. When looking at how much your claim will cost to take legal action versus the potential benefit to be gained in pursuing your claim, we consider things like: \n>The difficulty of the case. Cases which are \nmore difficult usually have greater legal costs\nattached to them.\n>The potential total value of the case. This includes the amount of damages you may be able to recover from the other party.\n>The non-financial value of the case. Sometimes your claim will have a benefit to you which is difficult to value in financial terms but is still worth pursuing. For these claims your \nappointed representative  will \ntake the benefit to you into account when calculating the total value of your claim.\n>If it would be reasonable to spend more in pursuing a claim than the benefit you would get in doing so.\nYour \nappointed representative  will assess the \npotential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost to take legal action.\nIf there are conflicting opinions about whether \nyour claim is likely to succeed, we’ll ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister.

Your appointed representative can be:\n>From a preferred law firm that we suggest.\n>Your own choice of appointed representative\n– however you can’t choose your own appointed representative if it’s a contract dispute until it’s necessary to take your claim to court, or if there’s a conflict of interest.\nIf you choose an appointed representative who \nisn’t from a preferred law firm, they must agree \nto our terms of appointment.

This includes the amount of damages you may be able to recover from the other party.\n>The non-financial value of the case. Sometimes your claim will have a benefit to you which is difficult to value in financial terms but is still worth pursuing. For these claims your \nappointed representative  will \ntake the benefit to you into account when calculating the total value of your claim.\n>If it would be reasonable to spend more in pursuing a claim than the benefit you would get in doing so.\nYour \nappointed representative  will assess the \npotential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost to take legal action.\nIf there are conflicting opinions about whether \nyour claim is likely to succeed, we’ll ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister.

Don’t accept blame for the accident. \n4\nWitnesses\nIf any passers-by have stopped, you can ask \nfor their contact details.
